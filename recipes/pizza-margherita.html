        <h2>Description</h2>
        
            <p>Pizza margherita, as the Italians call it, 
            is a simple pizza hailing from Naples. When done right, 
            margherita pizza features a bubbly crust, crushed San Marzano tomato sauce, 
            fresh mozzarella and basil, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt. 
            That is all.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
                <li>¼ cup flour for dusting</li>
                <li>2 cups pizza sauce</li>
                <li>20 slices fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>20 leaves fresh basil</li>
                <li>olive oil</li>
                <li>sea salt to taste</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. 
                    Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. 
                    Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. 
                    When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 
                    about 8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. 
                    Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place 
                    (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
                     Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. 
                    Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. 
                    Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough. 
                    Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place 5 basil leaves on top. 
                    Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. 
                    Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls.</li>
                <li>Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. 
                    Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
